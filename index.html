    <h1>Class 2 Lab</h1>
    <p>Hello, my name is Jordan Covington.  I am from Campobello, SC but currently live at Joint Base Lewis-McChord. I am married and have two girls.  I spent four years in the Air Force on duty (stationed in Japan and Illinois) and have since been in the Air Force Reserves and currently in the Air National Guard. I graduated from college in 2018 with two degrees in Business Administration and Computer Information Systems. I am hoping to use my education and what I learn at Code Fellows to assist me in transitioning my career to software development.</p>
